How to structure notebooks?

Many small ones or fewer bigger ones?

Why are things changing while mouse is pushed?

Why is audio not updated on azure


Ideas:

adaptive noise cancelling

adaptive echo cancelling

phase has no affect on sound

bank account as convolution problem (compound interest)

predicting the share market (econometrics is glorified signal
processing)


 This can be written as a convolution

$$y[n] = \sum_{m=0}^{M-1} h[m] x[n - m],$$

where the impulse response is a sequence of $M$ values each of amplitude $1/M$, i.e.,

$$h[m] = \left\{\frac{1}{M}, \frac{1}{M}, \cdots \frac{1}{M}\right\}.$$
