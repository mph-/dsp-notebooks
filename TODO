How to structure notebooks?

Many small ones or fewer bigger ones?

Why are things changing while mouse is pushed?

Why is audio not updated on azure


Ideas:

adaptive noise cancelling

adaptive echo cancelling

phase has no affect on sound

bank account as convolution problem (compound interest)

predicting the share market (econometrics is glorified signal
processing)


 This can be written as a convolution

$$y[n] = \sum_{m=0}^{M-1} h[m] x[n - m],$$

where the impulse response is a sequence of $M$ values each of amplitude $1/M$, i.e.,

$$h[m] = \left\{\frac{1}{M}, \frac{1}{M}, \cdots \frac{1}{M}\right\}.$$

vokoscreen record microphone and speaker monitor
May beed to use headphones to prevent feedback


echo cancellation, noise reduction and automatic gain control.


Echo cancellation  -- uses adaptive filter

You speak, it gets sent to your friend, they hear it via a speaker but
so does their microphone.  So it gets send back to you.  Thus you
would hear a delayed echo of youself.  Signal processing is used to
reduce this delayed echo otherwise is it continuously re-echoed.
Sometimes this leads to a howl, depending on the gains.  This is an
example of an unstable system.

You have probably heard feedback problems at a concert.
